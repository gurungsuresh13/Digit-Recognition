# Digit-Recognition
This repository contains a real-time digit recognition application using Pygame and OpenCV. Users can draw digits on the screen with the mouse cursor, and the application recognizes and displays the digits using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.


# Procedure
-Ensure you have the pre-trained model (digit_classifier.h5) in the project directory.
-In 'process_image.py', edit the model's path accordingly.

Run the application using:
'python app.py'

Draw digits:
- Use the left mouse button to draw digits on the left side of the screen.
- The recognized digit will be displayed on the right side of the screen.
- Use the right mouse button to clear the screen.


Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
